<h4> selected from the annals of history unto our current day</h4>

<pre>
'The holy gospel tells us that unless the grain of wheat,
falling into the ground, die, itself remaineth alone, and
does not bear fruit. The poor grain thus sown, how much must
it not suffer to die and fructify! It must endure rain, snow,
wind, and sun. The soul is a seed that God sows in the field
of holy Church; to fructify, it must die by dint of pain,
contradiction, and persecution.'
</pre>

<h4>St. Paul of the Cross</h4>
