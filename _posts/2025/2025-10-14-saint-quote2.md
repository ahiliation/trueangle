<h4>selected from the annals of history unto our current day</h4>

<pre>
'Blessed the one who has shone by the light of faith of
the Lord, like a radiant lamp on a tall lampstand, and
has enlightened souls that are darkened, for they followed
the heresy of the faithless and impious.'
</pre>

<h4>St. Ephrem of Syria</h4>
