<h4>On a dark night, Kindled in love with yearnings</h4>

<pre>
The first night or purgation is of the sensual
part of the soul, which is treated in the present
stanza, and will be treated in the first part of
this book. And the second is of the spiritual part;
of this speaks the second stanza, which follows;
and of this we shall treat likewise, in the second
and the third part,76 with respect to the activity
of the soul; and in the fourth part, with respect
to its passitivity.
