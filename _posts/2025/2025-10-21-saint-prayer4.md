<h4>'I love You, O my God'</h4>

<pre>
I love You, O my God, and my only desire is to love
You until the last breath of my life. I love You,
O my infinitely lovable God, and I would rather die
loving You, than live without loving You. I love You,
Lord and the only grace I ask is to love You eternally
. . . My God, if my tongue cannot say in every moment
that I love You, I want my heart to repeat it to You
as often as I draw breath.'
</pre>
