# Prayer That We May Seek God and Find Him

<pre>
Lord, teach me to seek you, and reveal yourself to me when
I seek you. For I cannot seek you unless you first teach me,
nor find you unless you first reveal yourself to me. Let me
seek you in longing and long for you in seeking. Let me find
you in love, and love you in finding.
</pre>
